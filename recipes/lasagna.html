          ground beef.

          the meat to add tons of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of
          tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance
          the flavor of the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh
          parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds,
          and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li>
          Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna
          extra decadent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the
