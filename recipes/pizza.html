    <h3>The following recipe is for the Italian dish pizza</h3>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, preferably San Marzano, drained
      </li>
      <li>Sea Salt</li>
      <li>"00" or all-purpose flour, for forming and cooking</li>
      <li>9 ounce pizza Dough, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 ounces fresh mozzarella, torn into strips</li>
      <li>2 large fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Instructions</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set a pizza stone on the lower rack of the oven, remove the other
          racks, and preheat to 500 degrees F.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Using a food mill, grind the tomatoes into a bowl (or pulse in a food
          processor until coarsely pureed.) Season with sea salt and set aside.
        </p>

          Very lightly dust a work surface with some flour. Fill a medium bowl
          with flour and spread it out into a wide even layer. Drop the dough
          onto the flour in the bowl, and flip it over once in the bowl to
          lightly coat it. On the work surface, using your fingertips, press the
          dough all over to flatten it. Flip it over and press all over the
          surface again. Flip it one more time and repeat. Press the dough with
          your fingers repeatedly on one side with one hand, and with the other
          hand, slowly turn the dough clockwise on the work surface. Continue
          poking and rotating the dough to flatten and stretch the dough.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pick the dough up and toss it back and forth between the palms of your
          hands until it begins to stretch, forms a rough disc, and gets
          thinner. Drape the dough over your hands, tuck your fingers in, and
          gently pull your knuckles toward the outer edge of the dough.
          Continue, rotating the dough as you go, until it is about 10 inches in
          diameter. Work slowly, allowing the weight of the dough itself to
          stretch and do not force it or it will tear and can make the crust too
          chewy.
        </p>
      </li>

          Dust the work surface with a little more flour and set the crust back
          down. Press it with your fingers and pull it gently at the edges to
          even out the circle. Using a small ladle, evenly spread about 1/4 cup
          of the tomato sauce over the surface of the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch
          border around the edge. Scatter the mozzarella pieces from the center
          out, leaving space between the cheese. Tear the basil leaves in half
          and scatter the pieces over the pizza.
        </p>
      </li>

          Lightly flour a pizza peel and set it on the work surface at the edge
          of the pizza crust closest to you. Run your fingers around the outside
          parameter of the crust to loosen any edges that might be stuck (and
          make sure the dough is not stuck to the counter anywhere in the
          center). Gently grab the dough at the 5 o'clock and 7 o'clock
          positions and in one, quick motion, pull the pizza onto the peel. Use
          your fingers to pull and straighten the crust until round.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Open the oven door. Set the front of the peel on the back edge of the
          pizza stone. Shake the peel very lightly to make sure the dough is not
          stuck and will slide. Holding the peel at a 45-degree angle, jiggle it
          until the pizza begins to slide off; once it reaches the edge of the
          peel, shake it lightly a few times, and then pull the peel out in one
          swift motion to drop the pizza onto the hot stone. Immediately close
          the oven door and cook until the crust begins to char on the bottom
          and edges and cheese is melted and bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use the peel to remove the pizza; slide it onto a cutting board. Slice
          with a pizza wheel and serve immediately.
        </p>
